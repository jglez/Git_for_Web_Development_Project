# Questions
    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
    Semantic HTML is HTML that conveys meaning such has headings, articles, sections, asides, etc. They're essentially all HTML elements that are descriptive or that describe the content inside them.

    2. What is HTML used for? 
    HTML is used for marking up the structure of a web page. In addition, it enables CSS to apply styles based on grouped elements so it is much easier and efficient. We do this by using certain elements like sections, navs, divs, spans, or the class and id attributes.

    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
    Attributes are extra pieces of information about an element that are sometimes necessary such as the src and href attributes for img and anchor elements, respectively.

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
    The heading elements are used to denote titles. They have a hierarchical structure of significance where the most important title is denoted as a h1 element and so on until h6.

    <img> and <a>

    An id is an attribute which acts as a label for an element. It is meant to label a unique element for easy styling or to jump to a specific section by setting the id as the href in an anchor element. Each id can appear only once on a page.

    I believe it is the same situation as ids.

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
    As many times as you need, within reason. The same class value should be used to group similar elements for easier styling.

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one.
    An id is meant to select a unique element. You could use ids by jumping to a specific section on the page. 

    Classes are meant to group elements or label elements, for example if we wanted to create different classes for different sections of text so we could style each section only once instead of selecting them individually.
